###### Open project using PuppyGram-Howell.xcodeproj 

###### Project is not using any 3rd party dependencies 

#### PuppyViewController is the UICollectionViewController embedded in a UiNavigationController used for the main screen of the app. 

#### using MVVM (PuppyViewModel) to go out and fetch the flickr data etc.

#### There are some small issues with the stackView labels when you rotate the device, more requirements would be needed to nail down the collectionView layout etc. I believe there is a way to estimate the size for the stackviews that is a possible solution as well. 


###### The problem with git jokes is that everyone has their own version.
